Dear User, 

This project aims to explore wheter Large Language Models can be used to analyze open-ended responses.
It contains the following documents: 

1. prompts (The prompts provided to each model)
2. Cogito or Deepseek (contains the entire script that can be run to recreate my analysis, given that you have access to the dataset location.csv (access is      restricted for privacy reasons, I used real names in my examples, let me know if you would like access). Temperature paramters are set to 0, the user,         therefore, should reach the same conclusions) Note. installing each LLM using Ollama is required to run the code
4. Manual codebook (contains the instructions to the manual coder)
5. Interrater Agreement (can be run to recreate my entire analysis)
6. ShinyApp (The final application was tested on a pseudo-anonymized dataset. To give the user a better experience of the results i provide and interactive table)
