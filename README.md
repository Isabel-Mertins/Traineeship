This project aims to explore wheter Large Language Models can be used to analyze open-ended responses.
It contains the following documents: 

1. prompts (The prompts provided to each model)
2. Cogito or Deepseek (contains the entire script that can be run to recreate my analysis, given that you have access to the datasets
4. Manual codebook (contains the instructions to the manual coder)
5. Interrater Agreement (can be run to recreate my analysis)
6. ShinyApp (The final application was tested on a pseudo-anonymized dataset. To give the user a better experience of the results i provide and interactive table)
